I'm Haily Merritt. I'm a PhD student in Cognitive Science and Informatics (Complex Networks & Systems) at Indiana University. I'm interested in *network neuroecology*, so I study how variation in brain networks is related to variation in experiences in the environment. I'm especially interested in the social dimension of the environment. My research has a translational side and a theoretical side. For the translation side, I analyze human brain networks constructed from fMRI data. For the theoretical side, I build models of simple agents solving ecological tasks.
